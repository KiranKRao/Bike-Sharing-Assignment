Bike-sharing systems provide a convenient service where individuals can rent bikes for short-term use, either for a fee or free of charge. These systems often utilize computer-controlled "docks," where users can input payment details to unlock a bike, which they can return to any other dock within the same network.

# General Information

BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider in the US, has experienced a significant decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created substantial challenges for the company to maintain its position in the market. To address this, BoomBikes aims to devise a strategic business plan to swiftly boost revenue once lockdown restrictions are lifted and the economy begins to recover.

As part of this effort, BoomBikes seeks to evaluate the demand for shared bikes post-quarantine. Their goal is to anticipate customer needs, distinguish themselves from competitors, and maximize profitability when the situation improves nationwide.

To achieve this, they have engaged a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing shared bike demand in the American market. Specifically, the company is interested in:

### Key Objectives:

- Identifying the variables that significantly influence the demand for shared bikes.
- Assessing the extent to which these variables explain bike demand.

## Technologies Used

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- plotly
- sklearn

## Conclusion

- Business expansion should focus on the spring season due to higher demand.
- Poor weather conditions negatively affect bookings, leading to reduced demand.
- Humidity is a key factor impacting bike usage.
- High wind speeds also contribute to lower demand.

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by Upgrad Academy to enhance understanding of regression models.
